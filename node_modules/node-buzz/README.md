# Buzz - A JavaScript HTML 5 Audio Library

This is an npm installable (and therefore [browserify friendly](http://browserify.org/)) version of [Jay Salvat's](http://jaysalvat.com/) very nice [Buzz HTML 5 Audio Library](http://buzz.jaysalvat.com/).

None of the code is mine - I am literally just publishing the latest version to npm.  All kudos and credit should go to Jay.
